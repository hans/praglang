    """
    An environment which simulates conversation between two agents A
    and B in some situated environment.

    A represents the policy being learned. It can emit token sequences
    to B and process the responses from B.
    B is some fixed external resource (i.e., not a policy being learned)
    which accepts A's utterances and returns its own utterances. These may
    be a stochastic function of A's input.
    B can also directly (through Python code) modify the state of the
    environment.

    A can also take actions in the situated environment being wrapped by this
    class. A's action space thus consists of the product of the action
    space of the wrapped environment and the utterance space.
